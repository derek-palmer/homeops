# Branch Naming Patterns

This repository uses the following branch naming patterns for automatic branch builds in AWS Amplify:

- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `chore/*` - Maintenance tasks

These patterns enable Amplify to automatically create branch previews for pull requests.
